\subsection{Packet Filtering with pfilter}
\label{app:pfilter-overview}

When the {\bf pfilter} packet filtering system is turned on, the
default OSCAR settings allow any network communication between the
machines in the cluster, and allow ssh and http access to the cluster
main machine from the outside.

Communication between cluster machines and the outside network are
limited to outgoing connections only.  Incoming network connections to
cluster machines are blocked.

To allow outside network connections to ports on the cluster machines,
special rules will have to be added to the {\bf pfilter}
configuration.  See your cluster administrator for help on this.
