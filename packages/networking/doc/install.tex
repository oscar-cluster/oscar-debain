\subsection{Networking Package}
\label{app:networking-overview}

% Uncomment when configurator stuff is in

The networking package was created to set up the OSCAR server as a caching 
nameserver. %and/or set the clients' DNS server.  

By default, this package will set up a caching nameserver on the OSCAR server.
%If chosen in the configurator, this package will set the nameserver entry in
%the clients' \begin{verbatim} /etc/resolv.conf \end{verbatim}.  If the clients
%are pointed to an external (i.e. not in the cluster) DNS server, then their
%networking options (esp. gateway) are set properly.
