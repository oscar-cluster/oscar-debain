\subsection{HDF5}
\label{app:hdf5-overview}

\input{../../packages/hdf5/doc/common}

When compiling HDF5 in parallel mode, two compiler issues must be
considered:

\begin{itemize}
\item there is a bug in the \cmd{gcc} 2.96 compiler which affects
  HDF5.  To work properly, both the MPI implementation and HDF5 must
  be compiled with a compiler other than 2.96. The HDF5 Group suggests
  using \cmd{gcc} 2.95.3 for both.
  
\item when compiling HDF5 in parallel mode with an MPI implementation
  on a Linux system with kernels 2.4 or greater, you must specify that
  it should support $>$2GB file sizes.  For example, configure the
  installation of MPICH with the following configuration command-line
  option:

  \noindent {\small \verb+-cflags="-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64"+ }
\end{itemize}
